- I am from Salvador, a city in the northeast region of Brazil.
- I live with type 1 diabetes, which is a chronic autoimmune condition. I was diagnosed during my teens after a period of being terribly depressed. I use some [open-source cyborg software](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to live a happy life.
- I figured I am much happier living by the gender I want to, and being perceived as such. Thereʼs no replacement for being honest with yourself about who you are.
